# LTC Analyzer

Actually, it\'s the first real software i ever did, so it\'s kind of special to me. At the time, i was really into crypto and i wanted to check if arbitrage was viable. I choose Litecoin because it\'s cheaper to use its blockchain. The software tells how many times would we get more than 0.1, 0.15 and 0.2 percent of profit since we turned it on. I wanted to see how many times in a day could we start an operation, how much money would we spend with fees as well as how much is needed to get some proffit. I learnt that i needed more money than i had in disposal, so i think LTC Analyzer its path. I\'m greateful for it because it shown me how fun culd be coding a software and now i\'m doing Computer Science thanks to LTC Analyzer.
